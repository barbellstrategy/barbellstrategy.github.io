# The Barbell Strategy Strength, Science, and Simulation Institute

Founded by a team of Ph.D. computational modelers with deep knowledge across many domains, we have an institute dedicated to solving problems.  We specialize in creating computational models and apply our expertise across finance, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, and other fields heavy in applied mathematics. We specialize in quickly gaining domain knowledge to understand and study complex systems.

## Computational Modelling

Our work is generally proprietary and we don’t share details to maintain the competitive advantage for our clients. We provide services and solutions to entrepreneurs, private industry, and the DoD.  We design and exploit HPC systems to run complex production models and provide rapid research and development of domain-specific prototypes to gain insight into your problems.  We have experience creating statistical models to describe the data you have, dynamic models to make predictions and provide time-domain understanding, spatiotemporal models to understand where and when, and natural language processing for unstructured text. We use the best technology for the problem: were early adopters of neural networks, but don’t get stuck in the deep learning hype if that won’t provide the understanding our clients need. We tackle problems of all sizes and use the appropriate technologies for your needs.

## Private Invite-Only Elite Strength and Conditioning

A practical outshoot of our biology and health studies is the South Boulder Kettlebell Club where we use community to build strong and resilient humans. Being strong is the primary value of The BS4 Institute. Physically, mentally, and emotionally strong people make our society great and we reject fear and weakness as a driver of behavior. All problems are solved by approaching them from a position of strength, curiosity, and a desire to learn.

Back-to-basics strength training with the barbell and kettlebell. Simple antiglycolytic metabolic conditioning developed from years of research. Training shouldn't be complicated. We've subtracted all the unnecessary pieces and created smart programming centered around just barbells and kettlebells. [Subscribe to our newsletter](https://sbkb.substack.com/) to learn more.
