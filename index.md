# The Barbell Strategy <br/>Strength, Science, and Simulation <br/>Institute

Founded by a team of Ph.D. computational modelers with deep knowledge across many domains, The BS4 Institute is dedicated to solving complex problems. We specialize in creating computational models and apply our expertise across finance, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, medicine, and other fields heavy in applied computational mathematics. We specialize in quickly gaining domain knowledge to understand and study complex systems.

## Computational Modeling and Applied Mathematics

Our work is generally proprietary and we can’t share details to maintain the competitive advantage for our clients. Our diverse set of team members provide services and solutions to entrepreneurs, industry, and the DoD. We design and exploit HPC systems to run complex production models and provide rapid research and development of domain-specific prototypes to gain insight into your problems. We have experience creating statistical models to describe the data you have, dynamic models to make predictions and provide time-domain understanding, spatiotemporal models to understand “where and when”, and natural language processing for unstructured text. We use the best technology for the problem: we were early adopters of neural networks, but don’t get stuck in the deep learning hype if that won’t provide the understanding our clients need. We tackle problems of all sizes and use the appropriate technologies for your needs.

## Elite-level Strength and Conditioning

A practical outshoot of our biology and health studies is the South Boulder Kettlebell Club which evolved from our S&C gym, [Barbell Strategy](workouts.md). We operated an elite-level open-to-all strength and conditioning facility in beautiful South Boulder Colorado from 2015 to 2020. A focus on smart strength training and community building was a primary component in building strong and resilient humans. Being strong is the primary value of The BS4 Institute: physically, mentally, and emotionally strong people make our society great and we reject fear and weakness as a driver of behavior. All problems are solved by approaching them from a position of strength, curiosity, and a desire to learn.

To run a gym in an expensive place like Boulder, we had to charge more for membership than we wanted. The people who most benefit from our style of health and resilience training can’t afford it. But we still had to pay rent. In March of 2020 when no one could meet inside we started the outside-only South Boulder Kettlebell Club. The plan was to support the community we built and provide access to maintain the physical and mental health of our community during an unprecedented tough time.

The SBKB never slowed down, we now offer equitable access to elite-level training through our free community program. Anyone who wants to put the work in can join us for a free workout every weekday at the South Boulder Kettlebell Club. We provide simple antiglycolytic metabolic conditioning developed from years of research using dedicated coaches who donate their time and space. We've subtracted all the unnecessary pieces and created smart programming centered around just barbells, kettlebells, and the natural environment. Add in a community of like-minded folks and we have found the recipe for creating a network of strong and reliable people in Boulder.

A collection of our writings is [over here](articles.md). Mostly what you’ll find is our strength and health work because that’s self-funded and we can share that.
