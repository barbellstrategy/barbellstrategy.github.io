# The Barbell Strategy <br/>Strength, Science, and Simulation <br/>Institute

Founded by a team of Ph.D. computational modelers with deep knowledge across many domains, The BS4 Institute is dedicated to solving complex problems.  We specialize in creating computational models and apply our expertise across finance, physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, medicine, and other fields heavy in applied mathematics. We specialize in quickly gaining domain knowledge to understand and study complex systems.

## Computational Modeling

Our work is generally proprietary and we don’t share details to maintain the competitive advantage for our clients. Our team members provide services and solutions to entrepreneurs, industry, and the DoD.  We design and exploit HPC systems to run complex production models and provide rapid research and development of domain-specific prototypes to gain insight into your problems.  We have experience creating statistical models to describe the data you have, dynamic models to make predictions and provide time-domain understanding, spatiotemporal models to understand “where and when”, and natural language processing for unstructured text. We use the best technology for the problem: we were early adopters of neural networks, but don’t get stuck in the deep learning hype if that won’t provide the understanding our clients need. We tackle problems of all sizes and use the appropriate technologies for your needs.

## Pro Bono Work

If our work can help a good cause, we often will take a client pro bono.  We are a non-partisan group interested in understanding complex systems. Reach out if you think we can help you.

## Private Invite-Only Elite Strength and Conditioning

A practical outshoot of our biology and health studies is the South Boulder Kettlebell Club (which evolved from our public S&C gym, [Barbell Strategy](workouts.md)) where we use iron and community to build strong and resilient humans. Being strong is the primary value of The BS4 Institute. Physically, mentally, and emotionally strong people make our society great and we reject fear and weakness as a driver of behavior. All problems are solved by approaching them from a position of strength, curiosity, and a desire to learn.

Back-to-basics strength training with the barbell and kettlebell. Simple antiglycolytic metabolic conditioning developed from years of research. Training shouldn't be complicated. We've subtracted all the unnecessary pieces and created smart programming centered around just barbells and kettlebells. [Subscribe to our newsletter](https://sbkb.substack.com/) to learn more.

## Articles

A collection of our writings is [over here](articles.md).  Mostly what you’ll find is our strength and health work because that’s self-funded and we can share that.
