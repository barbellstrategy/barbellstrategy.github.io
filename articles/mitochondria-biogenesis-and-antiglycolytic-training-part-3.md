# Mitochondria Biogenesis and Antiglycolytic Training Part 3

Did you read the last two posts ([one](mitochondria-biogenesis-and-antiglycolytic-training-part-1.md), [two](mitochondria-biogenesis-and-antiglycolytic-training-part-2.md)) on why you shouldn't eat vegetable oils and why AGT is so good? If not, go back and read those!

So if AGT, and in particular the A+A work we so often do is so good, why is this month's programming a little different? 

We do need to mix it up so that your body doesn't get too adapted to one mode of training. This month we're just lightly tapping into the glycolytic pathway - but don't worry, we're not going crazy with it like a HIIT workout does.

If you remember my post about my personal WTF effect (sorry link to that doesn't exist anymore) with the Strong First Plan 996 workout, you can see that there is some good reason to touch the glycolytic pathway a little. You do want to be able to process energy fast if you need to. You just don't want to hit it every day!

What's the pattern of our work? We are doing four rounds of roughly one minute of hard work followed by about 9 minutes of rest. 

This is an exaggerated version of the 5 swings on-the-minute. The 25 swings is a long enough duration to tap into a little bit of needing to burn glycogen. But we stop before we go too deep into that pathway. And then we spend 9 minutes cleaning up from that and using our aerobic system to regenerate our ATP. All of the filler 2,3,5 work is there to 1) keep you from getting too bored and impatient, and 2) to help you pump out the lactic acid. You don't want that stuff hanging around damaging your mitochondria.

That's why I want those weights to be pretty easy - I want it to be *movement, not effort*. You don't want to create another demand for ATP. This is ATP regen time!
